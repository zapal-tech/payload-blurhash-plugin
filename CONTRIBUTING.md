## Security issues & vulnerabilities

If you come across an issue related to security, or a potential attack vector within this plugin or one of its dependencies, please DO NOT create a publicly viewable issue. Instead, please contact us directly at [`dev@zapal.tech`](mailto:dev@zapal.tech). We will do everything we can to respond to the issue as soon as possible.

## Documentation edits

Documentation can be found directly within its codebase and in the [README.md](/README.md) and you can feel free to make changes / improvements to any of it through opening a PR. We utilize these files directly in our website and will periodically deploy documentation updates as necessary.

### Before Starting

To help us work on new features, you can create a new feature request post in [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/zapal-tech/payload-blurhash-plugin/discussions).

### Commits

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for our commit messages. Please follow this format when creating commits. Here are some examples:

- `feat: adds new feature`
- `fix: fixes bug`
- `docs: adds documentation`
- `chore: does chore`

Here's a breakdown of the format. At the top-level, we use the following types to categorize our commits:

- `feat`: new feature that adds functionality. These are automatically added to the changelog when creating new releases.
- `fix`: a fix to an existing feature. These are automatically added to the changelog when creating new releases.
- `docs`: changes to docs only. These do not appear in the changelog.
- `chore`: changes to code that is neither a fix nor a feature (e.g. refactoring, adding tests, etc.). These do not appear in the changelog.

## Pull Requests

For all Pull Requests, you should be extremely descriptive about both your problem and proposed solution. If there are any affected open or closed issues, please leave the issue number in your PR message.
